## About
This personal project was a challenge I set to remake popular content sharing platforms with the focus of retreiving feedback from users.
The program involves the following features:
- Account creation via 3rd party using oAuth2
- Post uploading -> unfortunately I forgot to add this in the video. But it does exist.
- Post ranking system by date, all time views and most viewed this month.
- Post description, title and image viewing (with support for multiple images in gallery view)
- Post commenting & edit comment, delete comment and validation for one comment per user per post.
- AWS Integration (Elastic Beanstalk and utilising API to connect to file storage containers).
- HTTPS & SSL certificate auto updater.
- Account editing (username, profile picture, bio and communication preferences).
- Plain HTML, CSS and JS. With the exception of a couple libraries used for analytics and animation help.
